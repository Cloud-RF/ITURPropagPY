Description of the Digital Maps of Total Monthly Rainfall Included in Rec. ITU-R P.837-7:

The data file files v7_MT_Monthii.TXT (where ii=01, 02,… , 12) contain digital maps of MTii, 
the monthly mean values of total rainfall. 
The latitude grid is from -90.125° N to +90.125° N in 0.25° steps, 
and the longitude grid is from -180.125° E to +180.125° E in 0.25° steps. 

The companion data files v7_LAT_MT.TXT and v7_LON_MT.TXT contain the latitudes and longitudes, 
respectively, of the corresponding grid points in the MT_Monthii.TXT data files.

The total monthly rainfall data have been generated from the GPCC Climatology 
(V 2015) database over land and from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast 
(ECMWF) ERA Interim re-analysis database over water.

Description of the Digital Map of Rainfall Rate Exceeded for 0.01% of an Average Year 
included in Rec. ITU-R P.837-7:

The data file v7_R001.TXT contains a digital map of R001, the rainfall rate exceeded for 
0.01% of an average year. The latitude grid is from -90° N to +90° N in 0.125° steps, 
and the longitude grid is from -180° E to +180° E in 0.125° steps. 

These values have been computed using the method described in Annex 1 of Recommendation ITU-R P.837. 
Refer to Notes 1 and 2 for additional details.
The companion data files v7_LAT_R001.TXT and v7_LON_R001.TXT contain the latitudes and longitudes, 
respectively, of the corresponding grid points in the v7_R001.TXT data file.
