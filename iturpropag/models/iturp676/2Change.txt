Slant path: Use Annex 1 Eq. 13 
(needed: temperature, pressure, and water vapour density profiles along the path) 
or Annex 2 Eq. 40 
(needed: surface pressure, surface temperature, and surface water vapour density;
 can be used to predict: 
a) the instantaneous gaseous attenuation for a specific value of surface pressure, 
surface temperature, and surface water vapour density or b) the gaseous attenuation 
corresponding to the surface water vapour density at a desired probability of 
exceedance. If local surface water vapour density data is not available, 
the surface water vapour density maps in Recommendation ITU-R P.836 may be used.) 
and Eq. 41 (needed: surface temperature, surface pressure, and integrated 
water vapour content along the path; used to predict: a) the instantaneous gaseous 
attenuation for a specific value of surface pressure, surface temperature, and 
integrated water vapour content, or b) the gaseous attenuation corresponding to 
the integrated water vapour content at a desired probability of exceedance. 
If local surface integrated water vapour content data is not available, the 
integrated water vapour maps in Recommendation ITU-R P.836 may be used.)
